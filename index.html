		<h4>About Me</h4>

		<div class = "paragraph"><p> I am a recent graduate of University of Michigan with a degree in Computer Science. I currently work as a software engineer at Nordstrom. I was born in India and raised in Seattle. I fell in love with technology because I was surrounded by so many intelligent people in Seattle working at companies like Microsoft. What really made me get into computer science was my freshman year intro to CS class at UofM. <br> <br>

		Other than technology, I enjoy reading, traveling, and eating. I hope to visit all seven continents of the world before I am thirty years old. I am currently at three continents and about to visit my fourth. </p>
